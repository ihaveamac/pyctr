## This is my personal project

I make this project in my free time whenever I feel like it. I make no promises about reading issues or pull requests on a timely basis, or that I will fix certain issues or merge pull requests (soon or ever).

If you are making a significant addition and you intend for it to be implemented in my repository, you should talk to me first, because putting it in my repo means I have to maintain it. Please keep in mind the above paragraph. Maybe keep your own fork if you need something.

## No AI-generated content

This project, like all my projects, employs a strict zero-tolarance policy against any content generated by artificial intelligence, for any reason. Do not use it for issues, pull requests, comments, or anything else. Any content found to be the result of generative AI will be deleted, and the user likely blocked.
